# Heatwave

A Python Analysis CLI Tool designed for Aqua AIRS `.hdf` files

Commissioned by Chris Rentsch 


### Getting Started
1. Install Anaconda
2. Start an Anaconda Prompt
3. Install dependencies:

```
conda install py-hdf -c conda-forge
conda install requests
conda install pytest
pip install asciimatics
pip install pytest-randomly
conda install matplotlib
conda install pandas
```

### Example execution
```
python cli.py
```

The program will display the list of inputs required, their ranges, and their "<" versus "<=" distinctions.
Use a text editor to set preferred parameters in example.json (you can name this anything.json)

```
python cli.py example.json
```

Enter your Earthdata login and password
Program will run according to the settings in example.json file.

### What is the output?

There are two files:
1. `radiance_wavelength_month_2019-09-02_21-48-53_concatenated.csv`
2. `radiance_wavelength_month_2019-09-02_21-48-53_stats.csv`

Each file has the same dimensions.
- File 1 contains the average radiance for each latitude bin for each AIRS channel for each month processed.
- File 2 contains the count of radiance measurements that contributed to the average in file 1.

### Versioning
Version 17 was released onto GitHub for public consumption.
